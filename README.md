# LoRa Node

It uses the MCP73871 - USB/Solar panel charger and very nice TPS63031 Buck-Boost Converter. Main benefits of the board is small size and possibility to run literally forever from one small single cell LiPo battery.

It's necessary to <b>burn bootloader with ISP before RFM95W module is soldered</b>.

<b>ToDo:</b><br>
Change ground symbols<br>
Create BOM<br>
